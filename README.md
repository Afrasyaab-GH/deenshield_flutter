# DeenShield Flutter - Unified Desktop Guardian

A modern Flutter desktop application that unifies the **C# Desktop Guardian** and **Electron Manager** into a single, fast, and maintainable cross-platform solution.

## 🚀 Migration Summary

### **What Was Converted**

#### From C# Desktop App (DeenShield-Desktop_app):
- ✅ Password protection with encryption (SHA-256 + AES)
- ✅ Application discovery from registry and file system
- ✅ Process monitoring and blocking
- ✅ Advanced scheduling (Always, Weekdays, Weekend, Custom time ranges)
- ✅ Browser URL blocking via Windows registry
- ✅ System tray integration
- ✅ Admin privilege detection
- ✅ Modern Material Design UI

#### From Electron Manager (DeenShield-Desktop-Manager):
- ✅ Quick launch dashboard
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Todo list management
- ✅ Notes/memo feature
- ✅ System power controls (Lock, Shutdown, Restart)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.5.0+
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (for native compilation)

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\habib\PROJECTS\DEENSHIELD\deenshield_flutter
flutter pub get
```

2. **Generate Hive Adapters**
```powershell
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

3. **Run the Application**
```powershell
flutter run -d windows
```

4. **Build Release**
```powershell
flutter build windows --release
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Security
- **Encrypted Password Storage**: Uses `flutter_secure_storage` with SHA-256 hashing
- **Default Password**: `deen` (can be changed from Security tab)
- **Minimum Password Length**: 4 characters

### App Protection
- **Full Block**: Terminates app immediately when detected
- **Scheduled Block**: Block only during specific times/days
  - Always: Block 24/7
  - Weekdays: Monday-Friday
  - Weekend: Saturday-Sunday
  - Custom: e.g., "Mon,Wed,Fri 08:00-17:00"

### System Integration
- **Process Monitoring**: Checks every 2 seconds
- **Admin Detection**: Warns if not running with elevated privileges
- **Registry Management**: Blocks Chrome/Edge extension pages
- **System Tray**: Minimizes to tray instead of closing

### Dashboard Features
- **Live Clock**: Current time and date
- **Status Cards**: Guardian status and protected app count
- **Quick Search**: Launch web searches
- **Todo List**: Track tasks
- **Notes**: Quick memo taking

## 📦 Dependencies

### Core
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management
- `hive` & `hive_flutter`: Local database
- `window_manager`: Window controls & hotkeys

### Security
- `flutter_secure_storage`: Secure password storage
- `encrypt`: AES encryption
- `crypto`: Hashing algorithms

### Windows
- `win32`: Windows API access
- `ffi`: Native code interop

### Utilities
- `shared_preferences`: Simple key-value storage
- `path_provider`: File system paths
- `url_launcher`: Open URLs & files

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

### Why Flutter vs C# WinForms?
1. **Modern UI**: Material Design 3, smooth animations
2. **Hot Reload**: Instant UI updates during development
3. **Cross-Platform Ready**: Easy to port to macOS/Linux
4. **Smaller Binary**: ~25MB vs ~100MB+ with .NET runtime
5. **Better Performance**: Native rendering, GPU acceleration
6. **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler codebase, better tooling

### Why Flutter vs Electron?
1. **Smaller Size**: ~25MB vs ~150MB+ (Chromium overhead)
2. **Better Performance**: Native widgets vs web rendering
3. **Lower Memory**: ~50MB vs ~200MB+ RAM usage
4. **Faster Startup**: <1s vs 2-3s
5. **Native Feel**: OS-native controls and behaviors

## 🛠️ Windows-Specific Features

### Process Management
```dart
WindowsService.killProcess('spotify');
WindowsService.isProcessRunning('chrome');
WindowsService.getRunningProcesses();
```

### Registry Operations
```dart
WindowsService.updateBrowserBlocklist(true, [
  'chrome://extensions',
  'edge://extensions',
]);
```

### Power Controls
```dart
WindowsService.lockWorkstation();
WindowsService.shutdown();
WindowsService.restart();
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Admin Rights Required**: For registry modifications and some process operations
2. **Windows Only**: Currently targets Windows 10/11 (can be extended)
3. **No UWP/Store Apps**: Can only manage Win32 executables
4. **Manual Refresh**: App list doesn't auto-update (requires manual scan)

## 📝 Development Notes

### Testing Without Admin
Most features work without admin except:
- Browser URL blocking (registry)
- Some protected process termination
- System-wide hooks

### Debugging
```powershell
# Run with verbose logging
flutter run -d windows -v

# Check for Windows-specific issues
flutter doctor -v
```

### Building
```powershell
# Debug build (faster, includes DevTools)
flutter build windows

# Release build (optimized, smaller)
flutter build windows --release

# Executable location:
# build/windows/runner/Release/deenshield_flutter.exe
```

## 🤝 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: `flutter pub get`
2. **Generate Hive adapters**: `flutter pub run build_runner build`
3. **Run the app**: `flutter run -d windows`
4. **Implement remaining tabs**: Apps, Browser, Security
5. **Add system tray integration**
6. **Test all features thoroughly**
