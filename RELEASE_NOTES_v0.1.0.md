DeenShield is built on Islamic principles:
- **Haya (Modesty):** Protecting your gaze and heart
- **Taqwa (God-consciousness):** Fearing Allah in private
- **Amanah (Trust):** Safeguarding your family
- **Ihsan (Excellence):** Striving for digital purity

This is a tool to **help** those who want to protect themselves. May Allah (SWT) accept it as continuous charity and make it a benefit for the Ummah.
