## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is DeenShield really free?**  
A: Yes! DeenShield is free for all Muslims. Donations are appreciated to support ongoing development.

**Q: Why is the source code private?**  
A: To prevent malicious actors from creating bypasses. Security through obscurity is a secondary layer. We're open to providing source code access for security audits.

**Q: Will DeenShield work without the desktop app?**  
A: The browser extension works independently, but some advanced features require the desktop app for full functionality.

**Q: Does DeenShield slow down my computer?**  
A: No. DeenShield uses minimal resources (~50-100 MB RAM) and runs efficiently in the background.

**Q: Can children bypass DeenShield?**  
A: DeenShield provides strong protection, but no system is 100% foolproof. It should be combined with proper Islamic education and parental supervision.
