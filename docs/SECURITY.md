- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
- Your name/alias for acknowledgment (optional)

---

## 🔍 Known Limitations

### v0.1.0 Experimental Release
- **Not Code Signed:** Installer not yet digitally signed (SmartScreen may warn)
- **Admin Bypass:** Technically savvy users with admin rights can disable protection
- **Browser-Only Protection:** Desktop apps can access internet directly if unblocked
- **AI Model Accuracy:** Content detection is ~85-90% accurate (not 100%)

### Future Improvements
- ✅ Code signing certificate (planned for v0.2)
- ✅ Kernel-level driver for app blocking (planned for v1.0)
- ✅ Tamper protection (planned for v0.3)
- ✅ Multi-user conflict resolution (planned for v0.2)

## 🎯 Threat Model

### What DeenShield Protects Against

✅ **Accidental Access**
- Children stumbling upon inappropriate content
- Unintentional visits to harmful websites
- Impulsive browsing decisions

✅ **Social Engineering**
- Phishing attempts with inappropriate content
- Misleading links to adult content
- "Curiosity clicks" on suspicious links

✅ **Moderate Technical Users**
- Average users who respect the protection
- Families seeking digital purity
- Muslims committed to lowering their gaze

### What DeenShield Does NOT Protect Against

❌ **Determined Attackers**
- Advanced users with admin rights can disable protection
- Alternative browsers without extension installed
- VPNs or proxies to bypass network-level blocks (not implemented yet)

❌ **Physical Access**
- Someone with physical access can uninstall DeenShield
- Booting into Safe Mode bypasses auto-start protection
- BIOS/UEFI level attacks (out of scope)

❌ **Zero-Day Exploits**
- Unknown vulnerabilities in Windows, Flutter, or Chromium
- Hardware-level exploits (CPU vulnerabilities)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Strong Guardian Password**
   - Use 12+ characters with mix of upper, lower, numbers, symbols
   - Don't share with children or untrusted individuals
   - Store securely (password manager recommended)

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Install updates promptly when notified
   - Check GitHub releases page monthly
   - Subscribe to security announcements (optional)

3. **Layered Protection**
   - Use DeenShield + parental supervision
   - Combine with network-level filtering (router settings)
   - Educate family about Islamic digital ethics

4. **Limited Admin Rights**
   - Don't give children admin accounts on Windows
   - Use Standard User accounts for daily use
   - Admin account only for installations/updates

### For Administrators

1. **Secure Installation**
   - Download only from official sources (GitHub releases)
   - Verify file size matches published checksums (when available)
   - Run installer with admin rights from trusted account

2. **Configuration**
   - Set strong guardian password immediately
   - Configure blocked apps based on family needs
   - Test blocking before relying on it

3. **Monitoring**
   - Periodically check if DeenShield is running
   - Verify browser extensions are active
   - Review app blocking list for changes

- ✅ Fuzzing and penetration testing
- ✅ Code review (request access for audit)

### Prohibited Activities
- ❌ Testing on others' devices without permission
- ❌ Distributing bypass tools or techniques
- ❌ Attacking our infrastructure (we don't have servers!)
- ❌ Social engineering attempts against users

## 🕌 Islamic Perspective

> *"Whoever conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allah will conceal their faults in this world and the Hereafter."* - Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

We ask security researchers to:
- Report vulnerabilities privately (concealing the "fault")
- Give us time to fix issues before disclosure
- Intend benefit for the Muslim community (Niyyah)

**JazakAllahu Khair** for helping us protect Muslim families online.
